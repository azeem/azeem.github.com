Excellent commandline tool to optimize PDFs for viewing in kindle. 
Nicely optimizes 2 column layout in academic publications. Also comes
with OCR support, which enables text selection and annotation in the
optimized PDF (though the conversion becomes significantly slower).
Available for Linux, Windows and Mac.
